Marpat is lightweight object modeling tool that uses ES6 classes to model data. This project is a fork of [Camo](https://github.com/scottwrobinson/camo). Marpat is designed to be a storage agnostic document collection backend. By default Marpat can connect to [nedb](), [mongodb](), and [firebase](). Additionally, Marpat provides a [Client Registry]() and [DocumentClient]() class. The client registry and DocumentClient class can be used to use a custom backend.

## Install and Run

To use Marpat, you must first have installed **Node >=8.0.x**, then run the following commands:

    npm install marpat --save

And at least ONE of the following:

    npm install nedb --save

    OR

    npm install mongodb --save

    OR

    npm install firebase-admin --save

## Quick Start

Marpat was built with ease-of-use and ES6 in mind, so you might notice it has more of an OOP feel to it than many existing libraries and ODMs. Don't worry, focusing on object-oriented design doesn't mean we forgot about functional techniques or asynchronous programming. Promises are built-in to the API. Just about every call you make interacting with the database (find, save, delete, etc) will return a Promise.

### Connect to the Database

Before using any document methods, you must first connect to your underlying database. All supported databases have their own unique URI string used for connecting. The URI string usually describes the network location or file location of the database. However, some databases support more than just network or file locations. NeDB, for example, supports storing data in-memory, which can be specified to Marpat via `nedb://memory`. See below for details:

- MongoDB:
  - Format: mongodb://[username:password@]host[:port][/db-name]
  - Example: `const uri = 'mongodb://Ben:abc123@localhost:27017/animals';`
- NeDB:
  - Format: nedb://[directory-path] OR nedb://memory
  - Example: `const uri = 'nedb://data';`

So to connect to an NeDB database, use the following:

```javascript
const { connect } = require('marpat')

const database;
const uri = 'nedb://data';
connect(uri).then(function(db) {
    database = db;
});
```

### Creating A Model

All models must inherit from the `Document` class, which handles much of the interface to your backend NoSQL database.

```javascript
const { Document } = require('marpat');

class Ghostbuster extends Document {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.name = String;
        this.age = {
            type: Number,
            min: 0
        };
        this.employees = [String];
        this.dateFounded = {
            type: Date,
            default: Date.now
        };
        this.
    }

    static collectionName() {
        return 'companies';
    }
}
```

Notice how the schema is declared right in the constructor as member variables. All _public_ member variables (variables that don't start with an underscore [\_]) are added to the schema.
The name of the collection can be set by overriding the `static collectionName()` method, which should return the desired collection name as a string. If one isn't given, then Marpat uses the name of the class and naively appends an 's' to the end to make it plural. Schemas can also be defined using the `this.schema()` method. For example, in the `constructor()` method you could use:

```javascript
this.schema({
  name: String,
  valuation: {
    type: Number,
    default: 10000000000,
    min: 0
  },
  employees: [String],
  dateFounded: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});
```

Currently supported variable types are:

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Buffer`
- `Date`
- `Object`
- `Array`
- `EmbeddedDocument`
- Document Reference
- Joi Schema

Arrays can either be declared as either un-typed (using `Array` or `[]`), or typed (using the `[TYPE]` syntax, like `[String]`). Typed arrays are enforced by Marpat on `.save()` and an `Error` will be thrown if a value of the wrong type is saved in the array. Arrays of references are also supported.

To declare a member variable in the schema, either directly assign it one of the types listed above, or assign it an object with options, like this:

```javascript
this.primeNumber = {
    type: Number,
    default: 2,
    validate: (value) => typeof value === "number"
    min: 0,
    max: 25,
    choices: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23],
    unique: true
};
```

The `default` option supports both values and no-argument functions (like `Date.now`). Currently the supported options are:

- `type`: The value's type _(required)_
- `default`: The value to be assigned if none is provided _(optional)_
- `min`: The minimum value a Number can be _(optional)_
- `max`: The maximum value a Number can be _(optional)_
- `choices`: A list of possible values _(optional)_
- `match`: A regex string that should match the value _(optional)_
- `validate`: A 1-argument function that returns `false` if the value is invalid _(optional)_
- `private`: A boolean indicating the member value should be removed by the `toJSON` method _(optional)_
- `unique`: A boolean value indicating if a 'unique' index should be set _(optional)_
- `required`: A boolean value indicating if a key value is required _(optional)_

To reference another document, just use its class name as the type.

```javascript
class Dog extends Document {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.name = String;
    this.breed = String;
  }
}

class Person extends Document {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.pet = Dog;
    this.name = String;
    this.age = String;
  }

  static collectionName() {
    return 'people';
  }
}
```

#### Schema Declaration

#### Embedded Documents

Embedded documents can also be used within `Document`s. You must declare them separately from the main `Document` that it is being used in. `EmbeddedDocument`s are good for when you need an `Object`, but also need enforced schemas, validation, defaults, hooks, and member functions. All of the options (type, default, min, etc) mentioned above work on `EmbeddedDocument`s as well.

```javascript
var { Document } = require('Marpat');
var { EmbeddedDocument } = require('Marpat');

class Money extends EmbeddedDocument {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.value = {
      type: Number,
      choices: [1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
    };

    this.currency = {
      type: String,
      default: 'usd'
    };
  }
}

class Wallet extends Document {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.contents = [Money];
  }
}

const wallet = Wallet.create();
wallet.contents.push(Money.create());
wallet.contents[0].value = 5;
wallet.contents.push(Money.create());
wallet.contents[1].value = 100;

wallet.save().then(function() {
  console.log('Both Wallet and Money objects were saved!');
});
```

### Creating and Saving

To create a new instance of our document, we need to use the `.create()` method, which handles all of the construction for us.

```javascript
const lassie = Dog.create({
  name: 'Lassie',
  breed: 'Collie'
});

lassie.save().then(function(l) {
  console.log(l._id);
});
```

Once a document is saved, it will automatically be assigned a unique identifier by the backend database. This ID can be accessed by the `._id` property.

If you specified a default value (or function) for a schema variable, that value will be assigned on creation of the object.

An alternative to `.save()` is `.findOneAndUpdate(query, update, options)`. This static method will find and update (or insert) a document in one atomic operation (atomicity is guaranteed in MongoDB only). Using the `{upsert: true}` option will return a new document if one is not found with the given query.

### Loading

Both the find and delete methods following closely (but not always exactly) to the MongoDB API, so it should feel fairly familiar.

If querying an object by `id`, you _must_ use `_id` and **not** `id`.

To retrieve an object, you have a few methods available to you.

- `.findOne(query, options)` (static method)
- `.find(query, options)` (static method)

The `.findOne()` method will return the first document found, even if multiple documents match the query. `.find()` will return all documents matching the query. Each should be called as static methods on the document type you want to load.

```javascript
Dog.findOne({ name: 'Lassie' }).then(function(l) {
  console.log('Got Lassie!');
  console.log('Her unique ID is', l._id);
});
```

`.findOne()` currently accepts the following option:

- `populate`: Boolean value to load all or no references. Pass an array of field names to only populate the specified references
  - `Person.findOne({name: 'Billy'}, {populate: true})` populates all references in `Person` object
  - `Person.findOne({name: 'Billy'}, {populate: ['address', 'spouse']})` populates only 'address' and 'spouse' in `Person` object
  - `select`: removes all properties from the returning data except those that match an array of values, or \_id and \_schema
  - `Person.findOne({}, {select: ['name']})` returns data with properties \_id, \_schema, and name.

`.find()` currently accepts the following options:

- `populate`: Boolean value to load all or no references. Pass an array of field names to only populate the specified references
  - `Person.find({lastName: 'Smith'}, {populate: true})` populates all references in `Person` object
  - `Person.find({lastName: 'Smith'}, {populate: ['address', 'spouse']})` populates only 'address' and 'spouse' in `Person` object
- `sort`: Sort the documents by the given field(s)
  - `Person.find({}, {sort: '-age'})` sorts by age in descending order
  - `Person.find({}, {sort: ['age', 'name']})` sorts by ascending age and then name, alphabetically
- `limit`: Limits the number of documents returned
  - `Person.find({}, {limit: 5})` returns a maximum of 5 `Person` objects
- `skip`: Skips the given number of documents and returns the rest
  - `Person.find({}, {skip: 5})` skips the first 5 `Person` objects and returns all others
- `select`: removes all properties from the returning data except those that match an array of values, or \_id and \_schema
  - `Person.find({}, {select: ['name']})` returns data with properties \_id, \_schema, and name.

`.findOneAndUpdate()` currently accepts the following options:

- `populate`: Boolean value to load all or no references.
  - `Person.findOneAndUpdate({name: 'Ben'},{name: 'Ben Danger'},{lastName: 'Smith'}, {populate: true})` populates all references in `Person` object
- `select`: removes all properties from the returning data except those that match an array of values, or \_id and \_schema
  - `Person.findOneAndUpdate({name: 'Ben'},{name: 'Ben Danger'}, {select: ['name']})` returns data with properties \_id, \_schema, and name.

### Deleting

To remove documents from the database, use one of the following:

- `.delete()`
- `.deleteOne(query, options)` (static method)
- `.deleteMany(query, options)` (static method)
- `.findOneAndDelete(query, options)` (static method)

The `.delete()` method should only be used on an instantiated document with a valid `id`. The other three methods should be used on the class of the document(s) you want to delete.

```javascript
Dog.deleteMany({ breed: 'Collie' }).then(function(numDeleted) {
  console.log('Deleted', numDeleted, 'Collies from the database.');
});
```

### Counting

To get the number of matching documents for a query without actually retrieving all of the data, use the `.count()` method.

```javascript
Dog.count({ breed: 'Collie' }).then(function(count) {
  console.log('Found', count, 'Collies.');
});
```

### Hooks

Marpat provides hooks for you to execute code before and after critical parts of your database interactions. For each hook you use, you may return a value (which, as of now, will be discarded) or a Promise for executing asynchronous code. Using Promises throughout Marpat allows us to not have to provide separate async and sync hooks, thus making your code simpler and easier to understand.

Hooks can be used not only on `Document` objects, but `EmbeddedDocument` objects as well. The embedded object's hooks will be called when it's parent `Document` is saved/validated/deleted (depending on the hook you provide).

In order to create a hook, you must override a class method. The hooks currently provided, and their corresponding methods, are:

- pre-init: `preInit(data)`
- pre-validate: `preValidate()`
- post-validate: `postValidate()`
- pre-save: `preSave()`
- post-save: `postSave()`
- pre-delete: `preDelete()`
- post-delete: `postDelete()`
- post-find: `postFind()`

Here is an example of using a hook (pre-delete, in this case):

```javascript
class Company extends Document {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.employees = [Person];
  }

  static collectionName() {
    return 'companies';
  }

  preDelete() {
    var deletes = [];
    this.employees.forEach(function(e) {
      var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        resolve(e.delete());
      });

      deletes.push(p);
    });

    return Promise.all(deletes);
  }
}
```

The code above shows a pre-delete hook that deletes all the employees of the company before it itself is deleted. As you can see, this is much more convenient than needing to always remember to delete referenced employees in the application code.

**Note**: The `.preDelete()` and `.postDelete()` hooks are _only_ called when calling `.delete()` on a Document instance. Calling `.deleteOne()` or `.deleteMany()` will **not** trigger the hook methods.

### Custom Database Driver

Marpat provides two default database driver (NeDbClient and MongoDbClient). If you need to write you own database driver you can register it with the Registry service.

```javascript
var { connect, Registry, DatabaseClient } = require('Marpat');

class MyClient extends DatabaseClient {
  static canHandle(url) {
    return url.indexOf('foo://') === 0;
  }
}

Registry.add(MyClient);

connect('foo://bar').then(function(db) {});
```

### Misc.

- `Marpat.Client()`: Retrieves the marpat database client
- `Marpat.Client().driver()`: Retrieves the underlying database driver (`MongoClient` or a map of NeDB collections)
- `Document.toJSON()`: Serializes the given document to just the data, which includes nested and referenced data

## Transpiler Support
